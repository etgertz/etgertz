I am Ethan Gertz, a student at Brandon University persuing my Bachelor in Computer Science. 

I am looking forward to contributing to Open Source Projects as I work towards finding a co-op job placement for spring/summer 2025.

I enjoy spending time out of class tinkering away at creative projects, and enjoying the great outdoors.

I have experience woking mainly in Java, with some limited exposure to python and C#.
